## Flask

Flask is a Python module that my ![Cookbook](./flask_loc_db/README.md) app uses. 

Flask is a lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja, and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.
