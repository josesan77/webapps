Python based webapplications

## Flask

Flask is a lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja2, and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

### CookBook

The app is designed to function as a searchable cookbook, featuring dish names along with detailed information such as ingredients, cooking instructions, and more.

Flask is a Python module that my ![Cookbook](flask_loc_db/README.md) app uses. 

### Flask-CV

A Curriculum Vitae (CV) generator app that allows users to input titles+types and descriptions for education, work, hobbies, and other relevant entries.

The idea is for users to compile a comprehensive list of their life events, career achievements, successes, certifications, and more. They can then select and customize an optimized list to create tailored CVs for specific job applications.
